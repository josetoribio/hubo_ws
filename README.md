Hubo Workspace

This project sets up a workspace for the DRC Hubo humanoid robot.
The DRC Hubo is a full-sized humanoid robot used for research in motion planning, control, and human–robot interaction.

In this workspace, the robot is connected to both ROS and Unity.
The system subscribes to all of Hubo’s joint states in ROS and simulates the robot’s motion in real time within Unity.
This allows for synchronized visualization and testing of robot behaviors in a 3D environment.

Features

ROS integration for joint state publishing and control.

Unity simulation for real-time visualization.

Compatible with standard ROS message types.

Designed for research and educational purposes.

Future Work

Add support for sensor feedback visualization.

Integrate inverse kinematics and trajectory control.

Enable bi-directional communication for teleoperation.

Would you like me to make it look even more complete — for example, add sections like Installation, Usage, or Dependencies (ROS version, Unity version, etc.)?
